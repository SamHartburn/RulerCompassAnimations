# RulerCompassAnimations
Animated ruler-and-compass constructions

Code is offered as-is for anyone who is interested. It is messy, undocumented, has no error handling and is probably full of bugs. Feel free to download and play but don't expect it to be perfect.

To see the animation you will need python to open an interactive window. If you use Spyder, you can do this by going to Tools > preferences > IPython console > Graphics > Graphics backend and setting Backend to Automatic.

Required libraries:
* numpy
* matplotlib

RulerCompassAnimations.py is a library to use Matplotlib to create ruler-and-compass constructions. It includes basic constructions such as perpendicular bisector, and helper functions such as calculating distances between points.

SquarePolygons.py is a library to use RulerCompassAnimations to construct a square with the same area as a given polygon.

Main.py shows how to use the SquarePolygons library.

RulerCompassAnimations.mplstyle defines Matplotlib styles to use.
